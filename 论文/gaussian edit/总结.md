## 设计gaussian editor算法来控制
* 原文
	```
	Finally, we have specifically designed a 3D inpainting
	
	algorithm for Gaussian Splatting (GS). As demonstrated in
	
	Fig. 1, we have successfully removed specific objects from
	
	scenes and seamlessly integrated new objects into designated
	
	areas. For object removal, we developed a specialized local
	
	repair algorithm that efficiently eliminates artifacts at the
	
	intersection of the object and the scene. For adding objects,
	
	we first request users to provide a prompt and a 2D inpaint
	
	ing mask for a particular view of the GS. Subsequently, we
	
	employ a 2D inpainting method to generate a single-view
	
	image of the object to be added. This image is then trans
	
	formed into a coarse 3D mesh using image-to-3D conversion
	
	techniques. The 3D mesh is subsequently converted into the
	
	HGS representation and refined. Finally, this refined repre
	
	sentation is concatenated into the original GS. The entire
	
	inpainting process described above is completed within 5
	
	minutes.

去除物体算法
1. 把gaussian点中的相关label去除
2. 通过knn找出临近点，进行优化

增添物体算法
1. 先通过原gaussian点生成多视图
2. 利用2d diffusion与promp prompt生成图片
3. 通过image-to-3d方法生成粗糙的3d mesh
4. 将其转为gaussians ，并且与HGS一同优化
5. 坐标系与原gaussians进行对齐
## 提出Hierarchical Gaussian splatting（HGS），
* 原文
	```
	Additionally, to tackle the significant challenge of Gaus
	
	sian Splatting (GS) struggling to fit fine results under highly
	
	random generative guidance, we propose a novel GS repre
	
	sentation: hierarchical Gaussian splatting (HGS). In HGS,
	
	Gaussians are organized into generations based on their
	
	sequence in multiple densification processes during train
	
	ing. Gaussians formed in earlier densification stages are
	
	deemed older generations and are subject to stricter con
	
	straints, aimed at preserving their original state and thus
	
	reducing their mobility. Conversely, those formed in later
	
	stages are considered younger generations and are subjected
	
	to fewer or no constraints, allowing for more adaptability.
	
	HGS’s design effectively moderates the fluidity of GS by
	
	imposing restrictions on older generations while preserving
	
	the flexibility of newer generations. This approach enables
	
	continuous optimization towards better outcomes, thereby
	
	simulating the buffering function achieved in implicit repre
	
	sentations through neural networks. Our experiments also
	
	demonstrate that HGS is more adept at adapting to highly
	
	random generative guidance
	```
用来指导生成GS
使用anchor loss来实现,$\lambda_i$越大，结构变化的惩罚越大
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text {anchor }}^P=\sum_{i=0}^n \lambda_i\left(P_i-\hat{P}_i\right)^2
$$
$$
\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{\text {Edit }}+\sum_{P \in\{x, s, q, \alpha, c\}} \lambda_P \mathcal{L}_{\text {anchor }}^P
$$

这里的$\lambda_i$随density次数增加而增加
## 提出 语意追踪
* 原文
 ```
	Gaussian semantic tracing consistently iden
	
	tifies the Gaussians requiring editing at every moment during
	
	training. This contrasts with traditional 3D editing methods
	
	that often depend on static 2D or 3D masks. Such masks
	
	become less effective as the geometries and appearances
	
	of 3D models evolve during training. Gaussian semantic
	
	tracing is achieved by unprojecting 2D segmentation masks
	
	into 3D Gaussians and assigning each Gaussian a semantic
	
	tag. As the Gaussians evolve during training, these semantic
	
	tags enable the tracking of the specific Gaussians targeted
	
	for editing. Our Gaussian tracing algorithm ensures that
	
	only the targeted areas are modified, enabling precise and
	
	controllable editing.
```
从static masks到动态追踪
1. 以前的3D编辑工作通常使用静态2D或3D掩码仅在掩码像素内应用损失
2. 这种方法存在局限性，因为3D表示在训练期间会动态变化，静态分割掩码会变得不准确甚至无效。
3. 使用静态掩码来控制NeRF编辑中的梯度是一个重大限制，因为它将编辑严格限制在掩码区域内。这限制了编辑内容自然地超出掩码的范围，从而将内容锁定在特定的空间边界内。

给高斯点添加新属性m, where mij represents the semantic Gaussian mask for the i-th Gaussian point and the j-th semantic label.

生成多视图渲染后，先经过二维的语义分割获得2d mask，再通过unprojection反推回gaussian中的各点，如果w超过阈值则设置m为对应的j
$$
w_i^j=\sum o_i(\boldsymbol{p}) * T_i^j(\boldsymbol{p}) * \mathcal{M}^j(\boldsymbol{p}),
$$
