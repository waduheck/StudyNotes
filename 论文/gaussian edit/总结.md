Gaussian semantic tracing consistently iden

tifies the Gaussians requiring editing at every moment during

training. This contrasts with traditional 3D editing methods

that often depend on static 2D or 3D masks. Such masks

become less effective as the geometries and appearances

of 3D models evolve during training. Gaussian semantic

tracing is achieved by unprojecting 2D segmentation masks

into 3D Gaussians and assigning each Gaussian a semantic

tag. As the Gaussians evolve during training, these semantic

tags enable the tracking of the specific Gaussians targeted

for editing. Our Gaussian tracing algorithm ensures that

only the targeted areas are modified, enabling precise and

controllable editing.
